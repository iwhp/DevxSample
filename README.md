#DEVX Sample
This projects implements a sample application using the following technologies:
- Server
  * Microsoft .Net Core (using C#)
  * Node.js (using TypeScript)
- Client
  * Browser
  * Mobile (Cordova)
  * Desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux - using Electron)

##Our Plan

We use Microsoft Visual Studio Code as the development plattform.

The **server** side code is implemented twice, once with C# (.NET Core) and once with TypeScript (Node.js).
The reason for this is a proof of concept.

We will use DDD (Domain Driven Design) principles.

As the data store we will use MS Sql, MySql, MonoDb.

The **client** side code is implemented with HTML, CSS and TypeScript.
We use different technologies to have the application running in the browser, on mobile devices (Android, IOS and Windows) and on desktops (Linux, Mac OSX and Windows).
The goal is to only implement the GUI once and deploy the 'same' source files to the different environments.
