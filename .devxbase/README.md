This project will help us generate DEVX applications.

One can provide configuration files and templates - the engine will generate code.

The following areas will be covered

* Application service (application entry point)
* Entity POxO - plain old C#/TypeScript objects
* Entity specification
* Entity validation
* Entity service
* Entity repository (interface)
* Infrastructure context
* Infrastructure repository

##Help needed

We are in the process of figuring out, which telechnology to use here. At the moment we 
are evaluating solutions with TypeScript as a language, Json as configuration files,
template files are just plain text files. **But which template language should be used?**
Frist we will have a try with **Angular2**.

If you are intressted in helping out, please leave a message. Thank you!
